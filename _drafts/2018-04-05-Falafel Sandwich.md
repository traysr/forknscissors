# Falafel Sandwich

# Serves: 4
 Falafel is a very popular Middle Eastern food. It is a deep fried patty prepared with chickpeas and served with pita bread. In this recipe, I prepared half deep fried and half shallow fried. This is my family favourite meal and we enjoy with yougurt dill sauce or hummus. Sometimes, we just eat patties as a snack.
