# Avocado Paratha and Yogurt-Cilantro Dip

# Makes 10 

### Ingredients:
### For Flatbread or Paratha:
* 2 avocado mashed
* 1½ tablespoon lemon juice
* Salt to taste
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder or 2 garlic cloves chopped
* 1 teaspoon red chilli powder
* Whole wheat flour ( around 2 cups) 

### For Dip:
* ½ cup chopped cilantro
* ¼ cup chopped mint leaves or 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* 2 green chillies
* Salt to taste
* 1 tablespoon chopped ginger
* ½ cup yogurt

### Method:
### For Flatbread or Paratha:
1. Mash avocadoes in a bowl. Add lemon juice, salt, garlic powder, and red chilli powder. Mix well.
2. Add flour - little at a time - to form dough. You may need less than 2 cups. I used 1⅓ cup flour. Cover the dough and keep it aside for 15 minutes. 
3. After 15 minutes, knead the dough again. Heat tava/griddle. Make equal size balls out of dough. Get extra flour in a plate for dusting.
4. Take one ball and flatten between your palms. Dip into the flour and start rolling in a circular shape. 
5. As you done rolling, place it on hot tava/griddle. Cook it from both the side by flipping to the other side.
6. Serve hot. 

### For Dip:
1. In a blender, add cilantro, mint, salt, green chillies, and ginger. Make a fine paste. Add a teaspoon water if needed. 
2. Pour the mixture into a bowl. Whisk yogurt with a spoon. Add yogurt to the cilantro paste. Check the salt and if needed, add more.
