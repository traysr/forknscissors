### Ingredients:
* 2 cups Bhajani 
* 1 onion chopped finely
* ¼ cup chopped cilantro
* Pinch of asafoetida (Hing) 
* Pinch of carrom seeds (Ajwain) 
* 1 teaspoon red chilli powder
* ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder
* Salt to taste (see notes below) 
* Oil
* Water

### Method:
1. Get a bowl and add bhajani , chopped onion, chopped cilantro, asafoetida, carom seeds, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, Salt ( if necessary) and 2 teaspoon oil. 
2. Mix everything with your hands. Make a soft dough by adding little water at a time. (I used around 1 cup water)
3. Make small sized balls out of the dough. Get a plastic sheet or ziploc bag. Get some water in a small bowl. 
4. Dab some water on a plastic sheet. Get one bhajani ball and pat it evenly with your fingers to make a circle. Make a small hole with your index finger in between the circle.
5. Heat tava/griddle. Brush with little oil. Transfer this thalipeeth from plastic on to the griddle. Add little oil in the center and on the sides. Put the lid on. Cook thalipeeth completely on a low-medium heat by flipping to other side in between. 
6. Serve hot with butter or yogurt. 

### Notes:
1. Some bhajani flour has salt in it. So, first check the ingredients of the flour and then add salt accordingly.
