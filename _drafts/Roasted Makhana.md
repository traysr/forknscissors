# Roasted Makhana

# Serves: 2 cups

# Makhana are also known as fox nuts or lotus seeds. It is a good source of protein, and high in fiber. In many regions in India, makhana is consider as a fasting food. You can use these as a snack or prepare porridge(Kheer), or curry. This is what I eat as a afternoon snack. Let's look at the recipe:

### Ingredients:
* 2 cups makhana
* 1 teaspoon olive oil or vegetable oil
* ¼ teaspoon red chilli powder
* ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder
* ¼ teaspoon chaat masala
* Salt to taste

### Method:
1. Heat oil in a pan and 2 cups of makhana. Roast them until they are crispy. This process takes 12-15 minutes on low-medium heat. 
2. Add red chilli powder, turmeric powder, salt, and chaat masala to the roasted makhana. 
3. Roast for a minute and turn off the heat. You can serve immediately or cool down and then eat. Store in a airtight container after you cool them down.
