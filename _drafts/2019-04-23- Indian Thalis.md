# Indian Thalis
Indian cuisine is diverse. It's a combination of extra spicy to extra sweet flavours according to the region where you live. The food preparation changes from state to state and season to season. Each region has its own spices, its preparation method, and its own identity. Indian food is known for its culinary and cultural presentation. 

Indian thali refers to a full course meal typically served on a plate and bowls. Curry, roti, rice, raita, papad, pickle, and a dessert are the main ingredients of a thali. You can divide thali in the following types:

Vegetarian thali
Non-vegetarian thali
Festival thali
Everyday thali 
Brunch thali
Fusion thali

I am a big foodie and like to cook on a daily basis. My mom and my grandmother were excellent cooks and my first Gurus. I used to help them in cooking preparations but never tried cooking by myself. After my marriage, I moved outside India and that was a turnig point for me. I started learning cooking by trying and experimenting.  Now since I have been living outside India for several years, I got a chance to meet and explore different cultures and their traditions. This is my humble attempt to show respect to their diverse culinary methods.
