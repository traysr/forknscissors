# Masala Idli

### Ingredients:
* 1 serving idli batter
* 1 teaspoon urad dal
* 1 tablespoon Dry Idli Chutney
* 5-6 curry leaves
* 1 teaspoon oil 
* 1 teaspoon ghee/butter
* Â½ teaspoon mustard seeds
* Pinch of asafoetida
* Salt and pepper to taste
* cilantro for garnishing

### Method:
1. Prepare the idli. Let it cool down completely. You can use leftover idlis too. 
2. Heat oil and ghee in a pan. Add mustard seeds. Let them crackle. Add asafoetida, curry leaves, and urad dal. 
3. Add idlis and gently stir it. Add dry idli chutney, salt, and pepper.
4. Stir for a minutes and transfer it to a plate. Garnish it with chopped cilantro. 

Note: I used mini idli mold for this recipe. You can use regular idlis too. Just cut them into small triangles. Be careful while adding salt since you have salt in idli and dry chutney too.
