# Fruit Cake

### Ingredients:
* 1¼ cup all purpose flour
* ½ teaspoon baking powder
* ¼ teaspoon baking soda
* ½ teaspoon mixed spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, clove)
* ½ teaspoon salt
* ½ cup butter
* ½ cup brown sugar
* ½ cup white sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 1 cup rum or apple juice
* 3 eggs
* 1 cup fruit and peel mix (orange and leamon peel, cherries, pineapple)
* ¼ cup raisins
* ¼ cup walnuts
* ¼ cup chopped dates
* Caramel
* 1 tablespoon milk

### Method:
### For the caramel: 
1. Add ½ cup sugar to the pan. Heat it and stir it. Let the sugar melt completely. The color will change to brown. Keep the pan aside and add ¼ cup water to the melted sugar very slowly. Bring the pan back to boil and stir it for another 5 minuts. Turn off the flame and keep it aside. Let it cool down completely.
2. Soak all the nuts and fruit mix in a apple juice or rum for a week. Keep the air tight container in a refrigerator.
3. Pre-heat oven to 350℉.
4. Sift together all the dry ingredients. (flour, baking powder, baking soda, mixed spices, and s salt) 
5. Cream butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together until it is well mixed. Add milk and vanilla. 
6. Add eggs one by one and mix everything with a hand blender. 
7. Get all the soaked nuts and fruit mix in a bowl. Mix 1-1½ tablespoon all purpose flour to the chopped nuts. Toss them and blend them in a creamed mixture. This will prevent them from sticking to the pan.
8. Add caramel and mix the creamy mixture with a spatula. 
9. Fold in all the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. 
10. Grease the round cake pan. Pour the batter. Bake for 40-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. 
11. Remove from the oven. Allow it to cool for 10 minutes in the pan. Transfer it to wire rack to cool completely. 

### Notes:
1. The baking time is different for everybody depending upon the oven and baking pan size. 
2. The fruit mix and nuts should get soaked properly. You can increase the amount of rum or apple juice accordingly. 
3. Be careful while adding water to the melted sugar. It may splash and cause burning.
