3. Heat a tablespoon ghee/butter in a pan. Add grated jaggery and a teaspoon of water. Keep it on low flame. Stir the jaggery continiously. Let it melt completely. It will start bubbling in a couple of minutes. 
4. When the jaggery stops bubbling, add sesame seeds, ½ teaspoon cardamom and ginger powder into the jaggery mixture. Switch off the flame. Mix it and immediately pour it on a greased plate.
