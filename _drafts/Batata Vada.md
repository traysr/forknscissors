# Batata Vada

# Serves: 3-4 persons

### Ingredients:

### For the potato stuffing:
* 5-6 boiled potatoes
* 1 onion chopped finely
* 5-6 garlic pods 
* 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro
* 2 green chillies
* 1½ tablespoon lemon juice
* 1 tablespoon oil
* ½ teaspoon mustard seeds
* ¼ teaspoon asafoetida
* 7-8 curry leaves
* ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder
* Salt to taste

### Batter for the outer cover:
* 1½ cup besan or gram flour
* ½ teaspoon red chilli powder
* Pinch of turmeric powder
* Salt to taste
* Water 

* Oil to fry

### Method:
### To make the stuffing:
1. Get a bowl and mashed the boiled potatoes in it. Make paste of green chillies and garlic pods. 
2. Add chopped onions to the mashed potatoes. Add garlic and green chili paste. 
3. Heat oil in a pan. Add mustard seeds. As they crackle, add asafoetida, turmeric, and curry leaves. Pour this mixture on to potatoes. 
4. Add chopped cilantro and lemon juice. Mix everything and cover it with a lid. Keep it in a refrigerator for 20-30 minutes. 

### To make the outer cover:
1. Get besan in a bowl and add red chilli powder, turmeric and salt. Add water to make the medium consistency batter. It should not be too thin. I used around 1 cup of water. 
2. Stir it properly. There should not be any lumps.

### To make vadas:
1. Heat oil in a pan. Get the potato stuffing out from the refrigerator. Make equal size of medium sized balls. Dip the ball into the besan batter and coat it evenly. Drop immediately into the hot oil. You can add multiple potato balls at a time dpending on the pan size. 
2. Deep fry them until light golden. Drain them on a paper to remove excess oil. 
3. Serve hot with garlic chutney.
