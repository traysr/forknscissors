title: "Strawberry Jam in Instant Pot"
---



# Around 2 cups



### Ingredients:
* 2 cups chopped fresh strawberries
* 1 cup sugar
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice

### Method:
1. Wash fresh strawberries and chop them roughly. Add chopped strawberries and sugar in an instant pot. Mix well and keep it aside for 25-30 minutes.
2. After 30 minutes, add lemon juice and mix again. Put the lid on into sealing position. Press manual for 1 minute on high setting. After 1 minute, let the pressure realese naturally. As the pin drops, open the lid. Mix everything with the spatula. Press cancel.
3. With the help of a potato masher, mash all the strawberries. The mixture should look like a puree. Turn on the saute mode and let it cook on high for 6 minutes. 
4. Put a glass plate or saucer in a freezer for 10 minutes. To check if the jam is properly done, drop a teaspoon of mixture on a plate. Place it in a freezer for a minute. If the mixture sticks and it is not runny, the jam is done. 
5. Turn off the saute mode and press cancel. Let the mixture cool down completely. Transfer the jam into sterilized jar or bottle. 
6. Keep it in a refrigerator. 

### Notes:
1. Since the recipe is not using any preservative, you have to keep the jam in a refrigerator. 
2. You can make this recipe on a stovetop. The time will be different but the taste will be the same. 
3. I used sugar according to the sweetness of strawberries. You can always adjust the measurement.
