Gudi Padwa is an auscipious day and new year for Maharashtrian community. It marks the begining of spring. This festival is celebrated on the first day of the month of Chaitra according to Hindu Lunar calendar. 
It is also celebrated in other parts of India with different names like 'Ugadi' and 'Cheti Chand'.


### Why Gudi Padwa is celebrated:

According to Hindu mythology, Lord Brahma created the universe. So, Gudi is a symbol of Brahma's Flag. It also symbolizes Lord Rama's victory over Ravana and Gudi represents the victory flag. Also, it is believed that Lord Rama returned to 'Ayodhya', his kingdom after completing 14 years of exile. 
In short, Gudi Padwa is the festival which brings prosperity, good luck and symbolizes victory over evil. 

### How do we host Gudi:
The important parts of Gudi are:
* wooden stick
* Bright colour cloth with brocade
* Mango leaves or Neem Leaves
* Flower Garland
* Sugar candy garland which is also known as Gathi
* Sliver or copper pot

A plated, bright colour cloth is tied to the wooden stick along with garlands, and leaves. A 'Swastika' symbol with 'Kumkum' (Vermilion) is drawn on the silver pot and it is placed in an inverted position. Gudi is hoasted outside the house in the early morning usually at the time of sunrise. Gudi is worshiped with 'Haldi Kumkum'. Houses are decorated with red and yellow marigold flowers and colourful rangolis. Maharashtrians usually wear traditional attire.
