# Ravyacha Upma or Sooji Upma

# Serves:2


# Rava or Semolina upma is one of the most easiest breakfast dish in India. There are many types of upma that you can make. But here is the very basic recipe which I have learned from my grandmother.

### Ingredients:
* 1 cup rava or semolina
* 1 medium onion chopped finely
* 1 medium tomato chopped finely
* 2 green chillies chopped
* 7-8 curry leaves
* 1 tablespoon grated ginger
* 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
* ½ teaspoon mustard seeds
* ¼ teaspoon hing or asafoetida
* 2 tablespoon oil
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* Salt to taste
* 1 tablespoon ghee/butter
* 3 cups water
* 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro
* 1 tablespoon grated coconut

### Method:
1. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a pan and add rava. Roast for 5 minutes until it gets nice aroma. Do not roast on high flame as it will burn rava. 
2. Keep the roasted rava aside. In the same pan, add another tablespoon of oil. Add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, hing, curry leaves, and chillies. Stir well. 
3. Add chopped onions and grated ginger. Stir for a minute and add chopped tomatoes. Let them cook on a low-medium flame for a couple of minutes. 
4. Take a bowl and add 3 cups of water. Start boiling it. Add this boling water into the pan with tomato and onion mixture. 
5. Add 1 tablespoon sugar, lemon juice, and salt to taste. When the water starts bubbling, add roasted rava. Stir continiously to avoid lumps in the mixture.
6. Put the lid on and cook upma at lowest setting. 
7. Add 1 tablespoon ghee on all over upma and give a quick stir.
8. Garnish with chopped cilantro, and coconut. Serve hot.
