### Method:

### To cook the rice:
1. Wash and rinse brown rice multiple times. Soak the rice in a cup of water for 20-30 minutes. 
2. Get a big vessel and add 5 cups of water. Add cumin seeds, cardamom, bay leaf, black pepper, and salt into the water. Bring the water to boil. 
3. Add soaked rice with the water to the boiling water in a pan. Stir it and let the rice cook. Do not put the lid on. Check the rice in between. 
4. Brown rice takes a long time to cook than regular white rice. The rice should not be overcooked. 
5. As soon as the rice is cooked, get a colander and pour the rice in. Let the water drain completely. Fluff with a fork and keep it aside to cool down. 

### To make the vegetable gravy:
1. Heat a tablespoon of oil in a pan and add ¼ cup sliced onion. Fry the onion for 5 minutes. Take out the fried onion slices and keep it aside for the later use. 
2. Add another tablespoon of oil in a same pan. Add remaining sliced onion. Add ginger and garlic paste. Stir it until the raw smell goes away. 
3. Add chopped bell pepper and mixed vegetables. Mix it and let them cook. Add chopped tomatoes. Mix well. Let the tomatoes and vegetables cook properly. 
4. Get 2 tablespoons of yogurt in a bowl and stir it to remove lumps. Add this beaten yogurt to the vegetables. Stir once again. 
5. Add turmeric powder, red chilli powder, garam masala, salt , 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and a tablespoon chopped mint to the vegetables. Give a quick stir. 
6. Once the vegetables are cooked, turn off the flame. 

### To layer the biryani:
1. Get a pan and lightly coat it with a cooking spray. Add little rice at the botton. Add half of the vegetable gravy all over the rice layer. 
2. Add half of the fried sliced onion over the vegetable layer.
3. Add rice layer again, following the vegetable layer. The top layer should be rice layer. Add chopped cilantro, mint, and fried onion on top.
4. Turn on the flame on low-medium heat. Put the tava on it. Place the biryani pan on it. Put the lid on and let it cook for 30-40 minutes.
