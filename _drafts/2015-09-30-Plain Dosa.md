### Ingredients: 
* 4 cups Rice
* 1 cup Urad dal
* 1 tablespoon fenugreek seeds
* Â¼ cup poha 
* Salt to taste

### Method:
1. Mix rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds in a bowl. Wash with water for at least 3 times and rinse. Fill the bowl with fresh water and keep it aside for 6-7 hours or overnight.
2. Next day, soaked poha in a water for one hour. Drain the water from Rice and dal mixture. Add little mixture to the grinder. Grind it to the smooth but grainy paste by adding little water at a time. 
3. Grind rest of the rice and dal mixture with poha.  Mix it properly. Set this batter aside in warm place with a lid on it. Let it ferment overnight or 7-8 hours. (I kept the batter in the oven) 
4. Next day, add salt to the batter and mix well with the laddle. Heat tava/griddle. Sprinkle some water on it and clean it with paper or towel. 
5. Get a laddle full of batter and pour onto tava/griddle. Spread the batter into circular motion with the help of a laddle. drizzle some oil along the side and top of the dosa. 
6. Let it cook for few minutes and then flip it to another side. 
7. Fold it and serve it hot with Coconut Chutney.
