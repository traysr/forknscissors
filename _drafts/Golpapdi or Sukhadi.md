Permalink: Golpapdi or Sukhadi

### Gol papdi or Sukhadi is a Gujrati traditional sweet prepared specially in winter. There are different versions to make this sweet but I made the simple version of it. It is a very healthy sweet for kids and new moms. The perfect blend of wheat flour and jaggery with the flavor of cardamom makes a unique healthy treat.

# Golpapdi or Sukhadi

### Ingredients:
* 1 cup whole wheat flour
* ½ cup ghee or butter
* ½ cup grated jaggery
* 7-8 almonds grated
* ¼ teaspoon cardamom powder

### Method:
1. Grease the plate with a half teaspoon of ghee. Keep it aside. 
2. Heat the pan and add ghee. Let it melt completely. Add whole wheat flour. Roast the flour until the raw smell goes off. The flour will change the color. This process my take 8-9 minutes. Do not keep the flame high as it will burn the flour. Stir continiously. 
3. Switch off the flame and add jaggery immediately. Mix it well. The jaggery will melt as the flour is hot. Spread the mixture on the greased plate and press well. 
4. Spread the grated almonds and the cardamom powder all over the flour mixture.
5. Cut into the desired shape. Let it cool down. Remove the pieces once it is cool completely. 
6. Store in a airtight container.

### Note:
* You can add a teaspoon of dry ginger powder into the mixture. 
* You can make Laddus instead of Vadi.
