 # Puranpoli

 

 Puranpoli is a traditional dessert made in India for the various festivals. Puran is a sweet stuffing and poli is a outer cover. Although it looks like a regular roti, but the preparation is different. 
 Puran is made with boiled chana dal cooked with jaggery or sugar and the poli is prepared with whole wheat flour or all purpose flour. It is usually served with 'Ghee' or milk. 

 Being a Maharashtrian, I have always seen making this delicacy during festivals like 'Holi', 'Gudhi Padwa', 'Shravan Shukravar' or during Ganapati-Gauri pooja. Puranpoli is offered to God with other regualr meal. In Maharashtra, Puranpoli is incomplete without 'Katachi Amti' which means dal. Poli is sweet so it is served with spicy dal which balances the tastebuds.
 This sweet flat bread is known by the different names in different states of India. The way of making also varies from state-to state. In Maharashtra and Gujarat, the method is kind of similar but the only difference is that the stuffing is different. 



  Puran poli is easy to make if you follow certain rules. 
  * The dough kneading is very important. The consistency should be soft. Keep the dough aside for minimum 1 hour or more. 
  * While making 'Puran', drain the boiled dal completely. There should not be any water. Reserve the drained water for making 'Katachi Amati' 
  * The ready 'Puran' should be hot while adding to the 'Puran Yantra'. This will give your stuffing a smooth texture. It will be easy to roll the poli. 
  * You can use your food processor or grinder to grind the 'Puran'. For this method, cool the puran first and then add to the grinder. The main purpose is there should not be any chunk of dal in the stuffing. Otherwise, the stuffing will come out while rolling the poli.
