# Chaitra Gauri Haldi Kumkum

Chaitra is a first month of the Hindu calendar. The first day of Chitra month is 'Gudhi Padwa' which is the Marathi new year. From the third day, Chaitra Gauri goddess (wife of Lord Shiva) is worshipped for one month. It is believed that the goddess Parvati visits her maternal home and stays there for a month.
The haldi kumkum ceremony is performed during this one month. The raw mango drink and raw mango dal, or chutney, is the main menu for this ceremony. It is a perfect occasion for ladies and kids to get together and dress up in traditional attire.
