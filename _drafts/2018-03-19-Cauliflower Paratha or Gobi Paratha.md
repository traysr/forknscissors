# Serves: makes 8 parathas 

### Ingredients:

### For the stuffing:
* 1½ cup grated cauliflower
* 1 teaspoon oil
* ½ teaspoon cumin seeds
* 1 tablespoon ginger grated
* 1 tablespoon garam masala
* ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder
* Salt to taste
* 1 tablespoon fresh grated coconut
* 2 teaspoon lemon juice
### For the cover:
* 2 cups whole wheat flour
* Salt to taste
* Water to kneas the dough
* 1 teaspoon oil

* Oil or butter to brush 


### Method:
1. Add whole wheat flour and salt in a bowl. Make medium to stiff consistency dough by adding little water at a time. Add 1 teaspoon oil all over the dough. Keep it aside and covered for 30 minutes. 
2. Heat oil in a pan. Add cumin seeds and let them crackle. Add grated cauliflower. Stir quickly and add ginger, garam masala, and turmeric powder. Mix well. Cook for a minute.
3. Add grated coconut, salt and lemon juice. Give a final stir. Turn off the flame. Do not overcook the cauliflower mixture. Cool down the mixture completely. 
4. Heat tava/griddle. Take 2 small balls from the dough. Roll them into a small disk. 
Add 1½-2 tablespoon of cauliflower mixture on one dough circle. Place another dough circle on top of the mixture. Press the edges with your fingertips and seal them properly. Sprinkle some flour on the stuffed paratha and start rolling again. 
5. Roll into a bigger circle or the desired size circle. Be gentle while rolling as the stuffing may come out. Place the rolled paratha and brush the sides and the center with some oil or butter. Cook from both the sides by flipping the other side. 
8. Serve hot with ketchup or yogurt.
