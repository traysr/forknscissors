# Makes 15 pieces

### Ingredients:
* 1 medium onion chopped finely
* 2 cup chopped mixed vegetables (I used corn, greenbeans & carrots)
* 1 boiled potato
* 3 garlic cloves
* 1 tablespoon ginger paste 
* 5 bread slices 
* ½ teaspoon turmeric powder
* 1 teaspoon red chili powder
* 2-3 tablespoon all purpose flour
* ½ cup fine sooji or semolina
* Oil
* Water
* Salt to taste

### Method:
1. Get chopped vegetables (except onion) and cook them in a pressure cooker (One whistle is enough) or steam in a microwave. Mash the boiled potato. Make garlic paste. Add bread slices into the blender to make bread crumbs. 
2. Drain water fron the cooked vegetables completely. Roughly mash them and keep it aside. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a pan, add chopped onion, and ginger-garlic paste. Saute well. Add all the mashed vegetables, mashed potato into the pan. Add turmeric powder, red chilli powder, and salt. Mix everything and cook for 5 minutes. Switch off the flame.
3. Cool down the mixture and then add bread crumbs. Mix everything. The mixture should not be soggy. Take small portion of the mixture and make patties in desired shape. 
4. Get flour in a bowl and and water to make thin batter. Get sooji or semolina in a plate. Dip the patty into the flour mixture and then place it on sooji. Prepare all the patties with the same procedure and keep aside. Make sure you coat them well with sooji. 
5. Heat oil in a pan. Add patties into the hot oil and deep fry them. Drain on a paper. You can also avoid deep frying. Just add little oil (around 1-2 tablespoon for 6 patties) in a pan and place the patties. Shallow fry them by flipping other side. 
6. Serve hot with ketchup or green chutney


### Note:
* You can use bread crumbs instead of semolina.
* You can add finely chopped green chili instead of red chili powder. 
* You can get rice flour for the batter if you dont want to use all purpose flour.
