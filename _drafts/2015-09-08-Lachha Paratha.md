# Lachha Paratha : 
 
 ### Ingredients:
 * 2 cups whole wheat flour + 1 cup of flour for dusting
 * 2 tablespoon of oil + Â¼ cup of oil for the layers
 * water to knead the dough
 * salt to taste
 
 ### Method: 
 1. Get a bowl and add the flour, salt and, 2 tablespoon of oil. Use water to make a smooth dough. It should not be too soft and too stiff. Keep it covered and keep aside for 20 minutes. 
 2. Devide the dough into 8-9 balls. Roll into a big circle with the roller pin. First, apply oil on to the circrle evenly. Then dip into the flour or you can sprinkle the flour evenly on the oil layer. 
 3. start folding the paratha just as you fold a paer fan. After you finish with folding, you can see the layers. Hold the ends of the roll and start pulling slightly. 
 4. Now roll the dough like a swiss roll or pinwheel.  Press the circle with your hands and start rolling again. Use a very little flour to roll. 
 5. Heat tava/griddle and place the paratha on it. When it starts changing its color or if the bubble appears, flip the paratha and cook the other side. 
 6. Appy some oil or butter on top. Serve immediately.
