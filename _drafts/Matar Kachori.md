# Serves: 12-15 kachoris

### Ingredients:

### For the stuffing:
* 1½ cup frozen green peas
* 1 tablespoon oil 
* 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
* 1 teaspoon fennel seeds
* 1 tablespoon ginger-chilli paste
* ¼ teaspoon asafoetida
* ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder
* 1 teaspoon red chilli powder
* 1 teaspoon amchoor powder or dried mango powder
* Salt to taste

### For the Outer Layer:
* 1½ cup all purpose flour
* 1½ cup whole wheat flour
* 1 tablespoon oil
* Salt to taste
* 1½ teaspoon ajwain or carrom seeds
* Water to knead the dough

* Oil to fry the kachoris

### Method:

### To make the outer layer:
1. Mix all purpose flour and whole wheat flour in a bowl. Add oil and salt. Mix everything with your hands. Knead the stiff dough by adding little water at a time. Cover and keep it aside for 20-30 minutes.

### To make the stuffing:
1. Heat oil in a pan. Add cumin and fennel seeds. Add green peas. Stir for a minute. 
2. Add asafoetida, ginger-chilli paste, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, and salt. Mix everything and let the peas cook. 
3. Once the peas are cooked, mash them using a masher. Turn off the flame and let the stuffing cool down completely. 

### To make kachoris:
1. Knead the dough once again. Divide the dough into equal size balls. Divide the stuffing into equal portions.
2. Get one ball and flatten between your palms. Roll out in a small disk, using a rolling pin. Put one stuffing ball in the middle. 
3. Bring the edges together and seal them. Remove any excess dough. 
4. Gently roll out the filled kachori into a small circle making sure the stuffing is not coming out. Repeat the same procedure for rest of the kachoris.
5. Heat oil in a pan. Add 2-3 kachoris at a time and deep fry them till they are golden brown.
6. Drain the fried kachoris on a paper towel. 
7. Serve immediately with green chutney or tomato ketchup.
