# Mixed Vegetable Paratha

### Ingredients:

### For the cover:
* 1⅓ cup whole wheat flour
* Salt to taste
* Water to knead the dough

### For the stuffing:
* ½ cup grated cauliflower
* ½ cup grated carrots
* ½ cup frozen green peas
* ½ cup chopped onion
* ½ tablespoon ginger garlic paste
* ½ teaspoon red chili powder
* 1 medium boiled potato
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice

* 1 tablespoon oil 
* 1 teaspoon cumin seeds

### Method:
1. Mix whole wheat flour and salt in a bowl. Make some dough by adding little water at a time. The dough should not be stiff or thin. Cover it and keep it aside for 15-20 minutes. 
2. Heat one tablespoon of oil in a pan. Add cumin seeds. Add chopped onion and ginger garlic paste. Saute well for a minute.
3. Add grated vegetables and mix everything. Stir in between. Do not overcook the vegetables. Add boiled mashed potato and mix well. 
4. Add red chilli powder, salt, and lemon juice. Quick stir and turn off the flame. Let the mixture cool down completely. 
5. Knead the dough again one more time and make 6 balls out of it. Get the stuffing and divide it into 6 parts. 
6. Get one flour ball and roll out in a small disk using roiiling pin. Get a stuffing ball and place it in the center of rolled flour ball. Gather the edges and seal them together. 
6. Flatten this ball with your hands and dip into the flour. Roll out in a circle using the rolling pin. 
7. Heat the tava/griddle. Place the rolled paratha and brush the sides and the center with some oil or butter. Cook from both the sides by flipping the other side. 
8. Repeat the same procedure with remaining stuffing and the dough. 
9. Serve hot with ketchup or yogurt or pickle.
