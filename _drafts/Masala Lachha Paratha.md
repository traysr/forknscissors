# Masala Lachha Paratha
# Makes 6-7 parathas

### Ingredients: 
* 2 cups whole wheat flour + 1 cup flour for dusting
* 1 tablespoon oil 
* Salt 
* Water to knead the dough
* ¼ cup ghee or butter
* ¼ cup kasuri methi or dry fenugreek leaves
* 5-6 tablespoon pickle masala or red chili powder

### Method:
1. Get a bowl and add the flour, pinch of salt, and a tablespoon of oil. Use water to make a smooth dough. Keep it covered and keep aside for 20 minutes. 
2. Knead the dough again after 20 minutes, and divide them into equal sized balls. 
3. Get one flour ball and roll out in a circle with the rolling pin. 
4. Apply one teaspoon  ghee or butter on to the circle evenly. Sprinkle couple of pinches of kasuri methi and pickle masala all over the paratha. 
5. Start folding the circle just as you fold a paper fan. You can see layers at the end. Hold the ends of the roll and start pulling slightly. For step-by-step photos see [Lachha Paratha](/recipes/lachha-paratha)
6. Now roll the dough like a swiss roll or pinwheel. Press the circle with your hands and start rolling again. Use the wheat flour to roll.
7. Heat tava or griddle and place paratha on it. When it starts changing its color, flip the paratha and cook on the other side.
8. Apply ghee on top and serve immediately.
