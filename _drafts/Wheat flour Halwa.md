# Wheat flour Halwa 

### Ingredients:
* 2 cup whole wheat flour
* 1  cup butter/ghee
* 4½ cup water
* 2 cup sugar
* ¼ cup slivered almonds

### Method:
1. Heat ghee in a pan and add whole wheat flour. Fry until the raw smell of flour goes away and it turns golden brown. The heat should be on low to medium. This procedure requires around 30 minutes. Saute continiously to prevent it from getting burned.
2. Meanwhile, add water and sugar in a another pan and start boiling. Let the sugar melt completely. 
3. Add the boiling water mixture to the wheat flour. Mix it well immediately to avoid lumps. Let it cook on a low flame while stirring continiously. Add half of the slivered almonds.
4. Turn off the flame. Garnish with remaining slivered almonds and serve.
