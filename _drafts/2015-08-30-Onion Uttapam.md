![Onion Uttapam](http://gallery.srujan.org/photos/i-2Mc4pgL/1/L/i-2Mc4pgL-L.jpg)

### Ingredients:
* 1 cup urad dal  
* 2.5 cups fine semolina (_rava_) 
* 2 large Onions, finely chopped
* Oil 
* Salt to taste

### Method:
1. Wash urad dal thoroughly and soak it in water for 5-6 hours. Grind it in a grinder to fine paste. Then add semolina and grind it again.
2. Take out the batter in a bowl and keep it aside for 8-10 hours (or overnight) for fermentation.
3. Add 2 table spoons oil and salt to the batter.
4. Mix the batter well and check for consistency (since due to semolina the batter becomes thick). Add some water if necessary. 
5. Heat non-stick tawa or griddle over medium flame. Pour a ladle full of batter and spread it into the circle with the help of ladle.
6. Sprinkle the chopped onions covering the top. Drizzle some oil around the edge.
7. Cook until the bottom side turns light brown. Flip it gently and cook another side over medium flame.
8. Transfer it to a plate. Serve hot with chutney and sambhar.
