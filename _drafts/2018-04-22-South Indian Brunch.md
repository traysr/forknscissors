# South Indian brunch

Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. You can skip a lunch or dinner but do not forget your morning fuel. We usually have a different breakfast for each day, but every once in a while, we'll have a late breakfast which eventually becomes our brunch. So for this weekend, we decided to have a popular South Indian delicacy, idli, with upma, sambar, coconut chutney, and filter coffee. 

I already have recipes uploaded for idli, upma, and sambar. These are the following recipes:
