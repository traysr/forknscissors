# Mango Kulfi

### Ingredients:
* 2 cans evaporated milk 
* 1 can condensed milk
* 1 can mango pulp
* 16 oz Whipped topping 

### Method:
1. Add evaporated milk, condensed milk and pulp in a bowl. Whisk it together. Add whipped topping and mix it properly. 
2. Pour it in a plastic containerand keep it in the freezer. 
3. Another way to serve is in a kulfi mould. Pour the mango mixture ina kulfi mould and store it in the refrigerator. 
4. I used small plastic cups since I don't have kulfi mould. Pour the kulfi mixture into small cups. Cover it with aluminium foil. Add popsicle stic in the center of each kulfi glass. Keep it in the refrigerator. This is a great way to serve in a party. 
5. While serving, just rub the chilled kulfi glass on your hand and the kulfi will come out. 
6. Enjoy.
