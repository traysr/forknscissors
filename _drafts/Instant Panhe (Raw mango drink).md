# Instant Panhe (Raw mango drink)

This recipe is an instant and quick way to make panha. Originally, panha is a summer drink which is prepared with boiled raw mango. 
The raw mangoes we get here are not sour enough to make panha. So, when I moved to USA, I tried this applesauce panha at my friend's house and it tasted just like my mom's. So, I am sharing this recipe so that you all can make it :) 

### Ingredients:
* 12 oz applesauce original
* ⅓ cup jaggary
* Salt to taste
* 1 teaspoon ground cardamom
* Water
* ¼ teaspoon saffron
* Pinch of yellow food colour (optional)  

### Method:
1. Heat a pan and add applesauce in it. Add jaggary and cook it until the jaggary melts. 
2. Switch off the flame and let it cool down completely. Add 12 oz water to the applesauce and stir properly. If you need a thinner consistency add more water. ( I added 1 cup water extra) 
3. Add cardamom powder, salt and saffron to the drink. Mix well and keep it in a refrigerator. 
4. Serve chill.
