title: "Brown Rice And Masoor Khichdi"
---



# Serves 2 persons

# Ingredients:

* ⅓ cup brown rice 
* ⅓ cup whole masoor sprouted
* 1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste
* 1 onion chopped
* 1 tablespoon oil
* 2 cloves
* 2 green cardamom
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 small cinnamon stick
* 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
* 1 teaspoon red chilli powder
* ½ teaspoon turmeric powder
* 1 teaspoon jaggery
* Salt to taste
* 1 teaspoon ghee/butter
* 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro
* 1½ - 2 cups water

# Method:
1. Wash and drain rice for couple of times. Keep it aside.
2. Heat oil in a pressure cooker. Add cloves, bay leaf, cinammon, green cardamom, and cumin seeds. Let them sizzle. Add chopped onion and ginger-garlic paste. Stir it for 5-7 minutes. Add Turmeric powder, red chilli powder, and half tablespoon chopped cilantro. Mix it. 
3. Add sprouted masoor, drain rice and mix properly. Add jaggery and salt to taste. 
4. Boil water in a different pan. Add this boiling water into the rice mixture. Stir it and check the salt. Put the lid on and cook this khichdi for 6-7 whistles. 
5. Do not rush to open the lid. Let the pressure go down and then open it. Add a teaspoon of butter/ghee and give a quick stir. 
6. Serve immediately with yogurt. 

# Note:
1. I like khichdi to be soft. So, I added 2 cups of water. You can add according to your preference. 
2. Since brown rice takes longer time to cook, I cook this khichdi in a pressure cooker. You can cook it in a pan on stove top.
