# Cabbage Paratha

* ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder
* ¼ teaspoon carrom seeds
* 1 teaspoon red chilli powder
* Salt to taste
* 1½-2 cups whole wheat flour
* Water to knead the dough (if necessary) 
* 2 tablespoon oil+ oil to brush the parathas

### Method:
1. Add grated cabbage in a bowl. Add pickle masala, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, carom seeds, and salt. Mix well with your hands. 
2. Add whole wheat flour and 1 tablespoon oil. Mix everything and make smooth dough. apply 1 tablespoon oil all over the dough. 
3. Heat tava/griddle. Make equal size of balls out of the dough. The number of parathas depends on how big you make the dough ball. Get extra flour in a plate for dusting.
4. Take one ball and flatten between your palms. Dip into the flour and start rolling in a circular shape. 
5. As you done rolling, place it on hot tava/griddle. Cook it from both the side by flipping to the other side. Brush some oil to the both sides.
