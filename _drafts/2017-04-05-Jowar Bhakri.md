# Serves: 2-3 persons

### Ingredients:
* 1 cup jowar flour or Sorghum flour
* Â½ cup whole wheat flour
* Salt to taste
* Warm water to knead

### Method:
1. Sift the jowar flour and whole wheat flour in a plate. Add salt to taste. 
2. Add little warm water at a time to knead the soft dough. 
3. Knead the dough with your hands for atleast 5 minutes. Shape them into round balls. 
4. Take a lemon size ball out of the dough and flatten it between your palms. Dust some jowar flour and roll them into round shape.
7. Heat the tawa or griddle and cook the bhakris from both sides.  
8. Take out in a plate and serve the bhakri with onion, Lasun chutney and Pithale.


# Note:
1. Jowar flour that I bought from the grocery shop was not fresh. So I could not make Bhakris in a traditional way. So I added whole wheat flour to it. If you have fresh flour, then do not use whole wheat flour. Just add warm water and salt and knead the dough. 
Flatten the ball in a circular shape with your palms. 
2. Keep the thickness of Bhakri according to your choice.
