# UP Style Aloo ki Sabji or Potato Curry

# Serves: 2-3 persons

UP, Uttar Pradesh is a state in northen India. The state is rich in culture and traditionand is also famous for the excellent cousine.  This is a very popular breakfast or brunch recipe in North Indian households. This spicy, tangy potato curry served with hot puris (fried Indian bread) is a feast in winter season.
My husband's family is from Uttar Pradesh. My mother-in-law is very good at making this recipe. Families in Uttar Pradesh may have different style of making this subzi but all of them are super tasty.  
Lets have a look at the recipe which I learned from my mother-in-law :)


### Ingredients:
* 10 small potatoes ( I used dum aloo potatoes)
* 1 medium tomato chopped finely
* 1 teaspoon saunf or fennel seeds
* 1 teaspoon jeera or cumin seeds
* ⅛ teaspoon methi dana or fenugreek seeds
* ¼ teaspoon kalonji or onion seeds
* ½ teaspoon asafoetida
* 2 dry red chillies
* ½ tablespoon ginger paste
* ½ teaspoon dhana powder or coriander powder
* ¼ teaspoon jeera powder or cumin powder
* ¼ teaspoon haldi or turmeric powder
* ½ teaspoon red chilli powder
* ½ teaspoon amchoor powder or dry mango powder
* 2 cups water
* Salt to taste
* 2 tablespoon chopped cilantro
* 1 tablespoon oil
* 1 tablespoon ghee or butter

### Method:
1. Boil potatoes in a pressure cooker or microwave. 
2. Heat oil and ghee in a pan. Add fennel seeds, cumin seeds,fenugreek seeds, and onion seeds. Let them sizzle. Add asafoetida and dry red chillies. Saute everything. Add ginger paste and chopped tomatoes. Cook for a minute on medium flame. 
3. Let the tomato get cooked well. Add red chilli powder, turmeric, coriander powder, and cumin powder to the pan. Mix everything. 
4. Peel all the cooked potatoes. Keep one potato aside and chop roughly rest. Add these chopped potatoes into the pan. Mix everything well and carefully. Let the potatoes be covered with all the spices. 
5. Add 1 cup of water, Salt to taste and 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro. In a bowl, get 1 more cup of water and mashed the remaining potato in it. Add this potato and water to the pan. Add amchoor powder and let it boil on medium heat for 5 minutes. 
6. Turn off the heat. Keep the lid on a pan. Let it cook on a steam for 1 minute. 
7. Garnish with remaining chopped cilantro and serve hot with Puri. 

### Notes:
1. If you want to use regular potatoes, use 2 medium size potatoes.
2. Sometimes, I also add ¼ teaspoon cinnamon powder and ¼ teaspoon clove powder to the curry with all other spices. This makes your subzi little more spicy. 
3. While making Puri, add a teaspoon of roughly crushed ajwain(carom seeds) or Kalonji(onion seeds) to the flour.
