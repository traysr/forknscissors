# Dal Vada

# Serves: makes around 35 vadas

Dal vada or lentil fritters is a very popular snack from South India. The main ingredients are chana dal and onion. I have added dill leaves in this recipe to make it more tastier. This snack goes perfect with Indian chai. There are many versions to this recipe but, this is my favourite and easy version. 

### Ingredients:
* 2 cups chana dal 
* 1 large onion chopped finely
* Â¼ cup chopped dill leaves
* handful of chopped cilantro
* Salt to taste
* 4-5 green chillies
* 1 inch ginger
* oil to fry

### Method:
1. Soak chana dal in a sufficient water for 5-6 hours. After 5 hours, drain the water from chana dal. 
2. Add drained chana dal, chillies, and ginger in a grinder. Make a coarse paste. Do not add water. If the mixture is not grinding properly, add little water.  
3. Add ground paste in a bowl. Add chopped cilantro, chopped dill leaves, chopped onion, and salt. 
4. Heat oil in a pan. Make a round lemon size balls out of the paste. Flatten them between your palms. Drop them into hot oil slowly. Deep fry them till they are fully cooked and change the colour to brown. Drain them on a paper. 
5. Serve hot with ketchup and chai.
