# Raw Mango Kadhi (Kairi chi Kadhi)

# Serves: 3-4 persons

Raw mango or green mango is also known as _Kairi_ in Maharashtra. You will get this fruit in the beginning of summer. This sweet and sour fruit is used in a variety of ways. For example: pickle, juice, jam, chutney are some of the common recipes. Or simply, just cut it into small pieces, sprinkle some salt and red chilli powder and eat it.
This recipe is something different than the usual one. I used boiled mango and jaggery. This sweet and sour kadhi goes perfect with rice.

### Ingredients:
* 1 large raw mango or green mango
* 2 tablespoon besan or gram flour
* 3-4 tablespoon grated jaggery 
* Salt to taste
* 2½ cup water
* 1 tablespoon oil
* ½ teaspoon mustard seeds
* ¼ teaspoon _methi_ seeds or fenugreek seeds
* 1-2 dry red chilli
* ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder
* Pinch of asafoetida

### Method:
1. Place the raw mango in a pressure cooker with little water. Cook it for 4-5 whistles. 
2. As the pressure goes down, remove the lid from the pressure cooker. Take out the boiled mango in a bowl. Peel the skin carefully and squeeze out the pulp. Do not use the skin and the seed. 
3. If the pulp is too lumpy and hard, grind it in a grinder and make a smooth puree. Add besan, water, and salt. Mix well. 
4. Start boiling this mixture on low-medium heat while stirring continuously. Add jaggery. (_See notes_)
5. Heat oil in a small pan and add mustard seeds. As they crackle, add asafoetida, _methi_ seeds, red chilli, and turmeric. Pour this seasoning on boiling kadhi. 
6. Give a quick stir and boil on low heat for another minute. 
7. Serve hot with rice. 

### Notes:
1. The raw mango which I get here are not sour enough. So I added jaggery accordingly. You can always adjust the sweetness. 
2. Traditionally, keep this kadhi aside for 4-5 hours after boiling to sink in. But, if you are in a hurry, you can always serve immediately. 
3. This kadhi is not too thin and not too thick. Adjust the water consistency according to the pulp.
