title: "Peek-a-boo Cake "
---



 I have decided to bake a kid-friendly surprise cake. So, I came up with the idea of making a peek-a-boo cake! A peek-a-boo cake is a normal cake on the outside, but when you cut out a slice, you find a surprising design or fun shape.

 I will be making a heart shape cake, but you can use any shapes you want.

### Ingredients:
* I used a Duncan Hines Spring Velvets' mix
* Water, eggs and oil according to the directions on the box
* A cookie cutter (I used a heart shaped one, but you can use any you want) 
* A loaf pan (I used a 4" x 8" pan)
* Cooking spray

### Method:
1. First let's work with pink cake mix. Mix all ingredients according to the directions on the box. 
2. Grease a loaf pan with cooking spray. Pour the cake batter and bake according to the directions. 
3. Let it cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes. Then cool it on the wire rack. 
4. Keep the cake in the refrigerator for 3-4 hours. Then cut the cold cake into slices (do not make thin slices). Place a cookie cutter on each slice and cut the desired shape. 
5. Grease the loaf pan again with the cooking spray. Get a bowl and mix all the ingredients for the yellow cake. 
6. Pour 1/2 cup of yellow batter at the bottom of the pan. Arrange all the cut slices in the center of the loaf pan. Pour remaining yellow batter all over the loaf pan. Make sure you cover all the slices properly. 
7. Bake the cake according to the directions. Let it cool down completely. Cut the cake and surprise your kids :)
