# Daal Chawal Bowl 
#Serves: 2 persons

 _Daal_ is a lentil curry and _Chawal_ is a rice. The concept of bowl is simply you add grains,proteins, vegetables of your choice and any seasoning for the flavor. I was trying to make healthy version, so I used brown rice. You can have your regular rice or quinoa too. For the proteins, I have used Indian style lentil curry. I used _toor dal_ (pigeon pea) but you can choose any other variety too. For the vegetables, I made a simple salad with tomato, onion and green bell pepper. 
I hope you guys like this Indian style healthy vegetarian bowl.
