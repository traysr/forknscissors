title: "Raw Mango Chutney or Kairichi Dal"
---



Kairi is a raw mango. This chutney is prepared with chana dal and chillies. This is a very popular Maharashtrian delicacy prepared during the Chaitra Gauri Haldi kumkum. 
Let's have a look at the recipe. 

### Ingredients:
* 1 cup chana dal
* 1 big raw green mango
* 3-4 tablespoon leamon juice
* 2 green chili paste
* 1 tablespoon oil
* ¼ teaspoon mustard seeds
* ¼ teaspoon cumin seeds
* Pinch of turmeric powder
* Pinch of asafoetida
* Salt to taste
* Chopped cilantro for garnish

### Method:
1. Soak chana dal in water for 5-6 hours. Afterwards, drain the water and wash the dal once again. Add drained dal in a grinder and make a half crushed paste. 
2. Wash and peel raw mango. Grate the mango and add it to chana dal paste. Add lemon juice and stir well.
3. Heat oil in a pan. Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds. As they crackle, add asafoetida and turmeric powder. Pour this on chana dal mixture. Add salt and chopped cilantro. Give a quick stir and serve. 

### Note:
1. Since the raw mango which I used was not that sour, I added lemon juice. Adjust the lemon juice according to the sourness of the raw mango.
