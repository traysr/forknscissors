Steamed mango modak

### Ingredients:
For outer covering
* 1 cup rice flour
* 1 cup water
* Few drops of mango essence
* Few drops of yellow colour
* ¼ tsp unsalted butter or ghee
* pinch of salt
For the inner filling:
* 1 cup fresh grated coconut
* ½ cup grated jaggery
* ¼ cup mango pulp

### Method:
1. Heat coconut and jaggery on a low flame in a thick bottom pan. Add mango pulp after the jaggery melts.
2. Stir at times and cook this mixture till it becomes dry. Don't overcook the mixture.
3. Switch off the flame and keep it aside to cool.
4. Heat the water, butter/ghee, mango essence, colour and salt in another pan . When this mixture starts boiling, reduce the flame and add the rice flour gradually.
5. Quickly stir and mix the flour completely with water and cover it with lid for 2-3 mins.
6. Switch off the flame.
7. Take all the dough in a flat plate or bowl and begin to knead it. First knead it with the help of spoon or bowl since it will be very hot. Then apply some water and knead the dough very well to make it soft.
8. Make small balls from the dough. 
9. Apply some oil on your hands. Take a ball and flatten it with your fingers to a shallow bowl shape and place the modak filling in the center.
10. Press the edges together. Remove the extra portion of the dough from the top. 
11. Make all the modaks this manner.
12 Grease the steamer lightly with ghee. Dip the modaks in water and keep them in a steamer pan. This will prevent them from cracking.
13. Cover the pan with a lid and steam for 10 to 15 minutes.
14. Drizzle some ghee on the modak and serve it hot.
