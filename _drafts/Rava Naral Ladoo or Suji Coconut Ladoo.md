# Rava Naral Ladoo or Suji Coconut Ladoo
# Makes 10-12 ladoos


### Rava laddu or Suji laddu is a MUST sweet for 'Diwali'.  There are different ways to make this ladoo but all of them are really easy. Basically rava ladoo is prepared with roasted suji or semolina with fresh grated coconut soaked in a sugar syrup with a cardamom flavour. 
 Let's have a look at the recipe.

 ### Ingredients:
 * 1 cup sooji or semolina or rava
 * ½ cup fresh grated coconut
 * ⅓ cup ghee 
 * 1 cup sugar
 * ½ cup water
 * 10-12 raisins
 * ¼ teaspoon cardamom powder
 * Pinch of saffron

 ### Method:
 1. Add suji in a pan and add half of the ghee. Start roasting rava with continiously stiring. The heat should not be high. After the sooji is half roasted, add fresh grated coconut. 
 2. Add remaining ghee and roast everything on a low flame. Transfer this roasted rava into a bowl. 
 3. Let's start making the sugar syrup. Add water and sugar in a pan and bring it to boil. Add pinch of saffron. Prepare one string consistency syrup. 
 4. Add this sugar syrup to the roasted sooji and coconut mixture. Mix well to make sure there are no lumps. Add cardamom powder and raisins.
 5. Let the mixture cool down for 2-3 hours. The sooji-coconut mixture will absorb all the sugar syrup. 
 6. Make round shape ladoos.
