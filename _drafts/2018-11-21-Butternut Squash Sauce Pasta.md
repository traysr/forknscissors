title: "Butternut Squash Sauce Pasta"
---



# Serves: 2 persons

### Ingredients:
* Half of the butternut squash
* 1 medium onion chopped
* 2-3 garlic cloves chopped
* 1 tablespoon olive oil + 1 teaspoon for pasta
* Salt and pepper to taste
* ¼ teaspoon red chilli flakes (optional)
* 2 cups water
* ¼ teaspoon basil leaves or oregano (I used penne whole wheat pasta) 
* 2 cups pasta 

### Method:
1. Peel the skin of butternut squash and cut into half. We are using only half of the squash for this recipe. Scoop out the seeds and chop into small pieces. I measured 2 cups of chopped pieces.
2. Heat oil in a pan. Add chopped garlic, onion and squash pieces. Sauté for a minute on low-medium heat. Add 2 cups of water and salt to the pan. Start cooking the mixture. Cook until everything is soft on a medium to high heat.
3. Meanwhile, boil pasta into the pan according to the package instructions. Add little salt and a teaspoon of oil while boiling.
4. Let the squash mixture cool down a bit. Then, add it to a grinder along with the water and make a fine paste.
5. Add this paste into the same pan. Turn the heat on to low-medium. Add cooked pasta along with pepper and chilli flakes. Check the salt. If necessary, add accordingly to the pasta.
6. Turn the heat off. Sprinkle some seasoning while serving hot.

### Notes:
1. If you think the pasta sauce is thick, add water to adjust the consistency as per your choice.
2. I wanted my pasta to be vegan. But if you don't want, you can add milk instead of water to make it more creamy.
3. Add seasoning as per your choice.
4. Sprinkle some parmesan cheese on top.
