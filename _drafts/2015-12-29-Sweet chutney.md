* ½ cup jaggary
* 1-2 tablespoon tamarind concentrate
* 1 tablespoon coriander powder
* 1 tablespoon red chili powder
* 1 tablespoon amchoor powder
* 1 tablespoon cumin powder

### Method:
1. Get a pan and add date and jaggary with enough water. ( aproximately 2-3 cups)
2. Add tamarind concentrate. Stir it properly. Let the mixture cook on medium heat. 
3. When jaggary gets completely dissolved in the water, add all the spice powders and salt. Give a stir and let it simmer for 5 minutes. 
4. Let the mixture cool down completely. Add the cooled mixture in a grinder and make a fine paste. Add little water if necessary while grinding.
5. Store it in a dry container.


### Notes:
* If you are using tamarind, then use seedless (½ cup). Add along with jaggary. 
* After grinding the paste, strain the chutney through a strainer and then store it in a container.
