# Vangyache Bharit or Eggplant Curry

### Ingredients:
* 1 eggplant (big) 
* 1 onion chopped finely 
* 1-2 small tomatoes chopped finely
* 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
* 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro
* 3-4 small garlic cloves
* 2 tablespoon oil
* ½ teaspoon mustard seeds
* ½ teaspoon cumin seeds
* ¼ teaspoon asafoetida
* ½ teaspoon turmeric powder
* 1½ teaspoon red chilli powder

### Method: 
### To roast an eggplant:
1. Line aluminium foil on a baking tray. Place an eggplant on it. Rub a tablespoon of oil all over the eggplant. Make 3-4 vertical slits on eggplant and insert a garlic clove in each slit. 
2. Place under a broiler and broil for 30 minutes with flipping in between after each 10 minutes. Make sure it is getting roasted from all the sides. Turn off the broiler and keep it inside for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, take it out and let it cool down a little bit so that you can peel away the skin easily. 
3. Heat a tablespoon oil in a pan. Add mustrad seeds, cumin seeds and let them splatter. Add asafoetida, turmeric and ginger-garlic paste. Stir it and add chopped onion. saute for 5 minutes. Add chopped tomatoes. Cook everything until the raw smell goes away. 
Add red chilli powder, salt and chopped cilantro. 
4. Peel away the skin of an eggplant and take the pulp out. (I usually discard the seeds but you can keep them) Mash it with your hands or fork. Add this mashed pulp into the tomato mixture. Mix well. Cook on a low-medium flame. Check for the salt and spicyness. Add more if needed. 
5. Serve hot with Bhakri.
