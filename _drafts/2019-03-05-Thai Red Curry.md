# Serves: Around 3-4 persons

Red thai curry is incredibly delicious recipe to make at home. Loads of vegetables and tofu simmered in a coconut milk gravy served with plain white / brown rice. The preparation time is also less and the cooking time is fast too. This is one of my favourite one pot meal.

* ½ cup carrot sliced thinly
* ¼ cup corn
* ½ cup tofu cut into cubed
* 1 yellow bell pepper sliced thinly
* ½ red bell pepper sliced thinly

* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1 tablespoon oil
* 1 can coconut milk (around 2 cups)
* 2 teaspoon soy sauce
* 2-3 tablespoon thai red chili paste (store brought)  
* Water

### To serve: 
* Cooked basmati rice

### Method:
1. Heat oil in a pan and add sliced onion. Saute for a minute and add minced ginger-garlic. 
2. Add cut vegetables and saute well.
3. Add red chili paste to the pan and fry for a while. 
4. Add salt and pepper to the taste. 
5. Empty the coconut milk in to the vegetables. Add ½ cup water to the vegetables.
6. Add tofu pieces to the coconut curry. Let the vegetables and tofu boil and cook.
6. Add soy sauce and turn off the flame.

### Note: 
* you can use any vegetables of your choice. You can add handful of spinach or kale to the curry. 
* Traditionally fish sauceis used in the recipe. Since i prefer vegan version,I used soy sauce.
* I used light coconut milk. You can reduce or add the quantity of water according to your choice. 
* I like to use uncooked tofu in the curry.
