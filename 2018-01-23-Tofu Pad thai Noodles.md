title: "Tofu Pad Thai Noodles"
---



# Serves: around 4 persons

### Ingredients:
* 8 oz packet of pad thai noodles or any rice noodles
* 1 red or yellow bell pepper sliced
* 1 big carrot thinly sliced
* 3 bunches of scallion or spring onions (chop both greens and onions seperately)
* Â¾th packet of extra firm tofu or 2-3 eggs beaten (see notes below) 
* 2 tablespoon crushed roasted salted peanuts
* 4 lemon wedges
* 2 garlic cloves chopped
* 5-6 tablespoon Pad thai sauce (I used store brought)
* 2 tablespoon Sriracha sauce (optional if you want spicy)
* 4 tablespoon olive oil
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Method:
1. Cook noodles according to the instructions on the packet.
2. Wash and cut the vegetables. Get tofu and drain the water from the package. Place the tofu on 2-3 layers of paper and place 2-3 layers of paper on top of it. Place a weigh on top layer of paper. Let it sit for 15 minutes. 
3. Add 1 tablespoon oil in a pan. Make square pieces of tofu and add them to the pan. Fry until the pieces are crisp and golden brown. Remove from the pan and keep it aside.
4. If you are using eggs, beat them together. Add salt and pepper. Heat a tablespoon  oil in a pan and pour in egg mixture. Allow to cook. Flip it to other side and cook again. Transfer the ready omelette on the plate. Cut the omelette into medium thin stripes. Keep it aside.  
4. Add remaining oil in a wok. Add chopped garlic. Add chopped onions (from scallions) and saute. 
5. Add rest of the vegetables(except greens) and tofu or egg omelette. Cook for 2 minutes, stiring in between. Add pad thai sauce, sriracha sauce, salt and pepper
6. Add noodles and bring the heat to simmer. Toss everything to combine. Cook for a minute. 
7. Serve immediately with crushed peanuts,chopped greens and a lemon wedge on top.

### Notes:
1. Add more or less vegetables as per your choice. Adjust the seasoning accordingly. 
2. You can add bean sprouts.
3. I like sriracha sauce to make it spicy. You can use any chilli sauce or completely avoid to make it mild. 
4. I like to add protein to my noodles. So, I use tofu or eggs. Sometimes both. You can avoid this too and add only vegetables. The tofu packet I used was 14oz.
5. Pad thai sauce has tamarind sauce, water, soy sauce, brown sugar, chilli sauce, salt, and pepper.
6. Usually, for cooking noodles, I use a large pan and add water and salt in it. Start boiling and add noodles. Cook for 5-7 minutes. Make sure they are not overcooked. 
Drain and set aside. Drizzle some oil to avoid stickyness.
