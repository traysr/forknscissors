### Ingredients:
* 1 serving green chutney
* 1 serving sweet chutney
* 1 serving ragda or 2-3 boiled potatoes
* Puris
* Â½ cup Tamarind or 1 teaspoon tamarind concentrate
* 1 teaspoon rock salt
* 1 tablespoon pani puri masala
* salt to taste


### Method:
1. Soak tamarind in the water for 30 minutes. Mash the tamarind with your hands and strain the mixture through the strainer. 
2. Get the green chutney in a large bowl. Strain the chutney through a strainer.  Add tamarind, rock salt, pani puri masala, salt, and 3-4 cups of water.
3. Stir the mixture properly. Keep this aside for 3-4 hours. 
4. Again, stir the water and adjust the masala or salt if necessary. 
5. Get the sweet chutney in a bowl and add water to make it thinner according to desired consistency. 
6. Get ragda in a bowl. If you are not using ragda, get boiled potatoes and mash them. Add salt and rock salt to taste and keep aside. 
7. Get a plate. Add 5-6 puris and poke them on top. Add teaspoon of ragda mixture in the puris. 
Add sweet chutney and green water according to your taste. Serve immediately.


### I used tamarind concentrate for this recipe. Since it is more sour than soaked tamarind pulp, you will need it less.
