# Thali is a plate with a full meal. Today, I prepared my version of vegetarian 'Gavran thali'. The word 'Gavran' means rural or country side. This meal is supposed to be a farmer's meal but because of it's healthy benefits and awesome taste, it has become popular in cities too. 

# The first ingredient of this meal is 'Vangyache bharit' or 'Eggplant Curry'. It contains roasted eggplant, onion, tomato, and ginger-garlic paste. Traditionally, eggplant is roasted on charcoal flame but you can use gas flame or oven to roast. For this simple Maharashtrian version of 'Vangyacha Bharit' click the link below:
