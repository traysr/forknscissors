### Ingredients: 
* 1 cup all purpose flour + 1 tablespoon 
* ½ cup granulated sugar
* 1 stick butter (½ cup) 
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 3 eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* ⅓ cup [tutti fruity](http://www.instructables.com/id/Tutti-Frutti-Colorful-Candied-Fruit-Cubes-From-Raw/)
* A pinch of salt

### Method:
1. Add butter and sugar in a bowl. Mix it properly with a hand mixer until the mixture is light. Add eggs and again mix it properly.
2. Add flour, baking powder, vanilla, salt and start mixing. 
3. Get another pan and add 1 tablespoon flour. Add tutti fruity in the flour and toss them and blend them in a batter. This will prevent them from sticking to the pan.
4. Preheat oven to 350℉. Grease the square cake pan. Pour the batter. Bake for 30-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. 
5. Remove the cake from the oven. Allow it to cool for 10 minutes in the pan. Then cut the cake into thin slices.
6. Reduce the temperature of the oven to 300℉. Arrange the cake slices on a baking sheet and bake the slices for 10-15 minutes. Flip to the other side and again bake for 10-15 minutes. Cake rusks should look golden brown. 
7. Remove from the oven and allow them to cool completely. 
8. Serve with hot tea or coffee.
