* 2 cups grated cabbage
* 2 tablespoon chopped cilantro
* 1 teaspoon garam masala
* ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder

* 2-3 cups wheat flour
* 1 teaspoon onion seeds (_Kalonji_)
* 2 tablespoon yogurt
* Water
* Salt as per taste

### Method:
1. Mix all the ingredients for the dough and knead it nicely to make a soft dough. Cover it and keep it aside. 
2. Add some salt to grated cabbage and keep it for 10 mins.
3. After around 10 mins remove excess water from cabbage by squeezing.
 Heat about 2 tablespoon of oil in a pan. Add the squeezed cabbage.
4. Add chopped cilantro, garam masala, turmeric powder and little bit of salt to it.
5. Keep on stirring , till the cabbage is cooked and the stuffing is totally dry.
6. When the stuffing is ready,switch off the flame.
7. Dust one ball of dough with some wheat flour for easy rolling.
8. Roll it out into small and thick circle. 
9. Add about 2 tablespoon of the cabbage filling and seal the dough ball from all the sides.
10. Dust in flour and roll out into big paratha. (Do not apply a lot of pressure while rolling since the filling might break out.)
11. Place the paratha on hot pan and cook on medium flame.
13. Turn it over, spread ½ teaspoon oil on both sides.
14. Paratha is ready. Serve it hot with chutney, yogurt or pickle.
