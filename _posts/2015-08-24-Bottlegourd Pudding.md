_a.k.a. Lauki ka Halwa, Doodhi Halwa_
### Ingredients:
* 3 cups grated bottle gourd (dudhi)
* Alum  (turti)
* 4-5 tbsp ghee / clarified butter
* 2 cups milk
* 1 cup sugar
* ¼ cup sliced almonds and pistachios
* Few strands of saffron
* 1 tsp cardamom powder

### Method:
1. Peel off and grate the bottle gourd. Immerse it immediately in pan full of water.
2. Swirl the alum through it once or twice. This helps to retain nice green colour of the   pudding. 
3. Now squeeze out the grated bottle gourd completely from the water.
4. Heat 3 tbsp of ghee in a pan and add the squeezed grated bottle gourd. Keep on stirring it until it changes its colour slightly.
5. Now keep on adding milk in small portions at around ½ cup at a time. It will avoid formation of lumps.
6. Cook it on a low flame while stirring in between.
7. Add the sugar, when the milk is almost evaporated. The sugar will melt. 
8. Keep on stirring for few minutes.
9. When the desired consistency is achieved add sliced almonds, pistachios and few strands of saffron.
10. Add 1-2 tbsp of ghee from sides of the pan. It will give a nice aroma to the pudding.
11. Now switch off the burner and add cardamom powder.
12. Garnish it with some more sliced dry fruits and serve it either hot or cold.
