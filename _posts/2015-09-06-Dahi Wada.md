6. Press the vada gently between your palms and squeeze out all the excess water and flatten it. 
7. Get 2 different bowls. Add 1½ cups of yogurt in each bowl. Add chili cilantro paste and ½ cup of water to one bowl and add sugar and ½ cup of water to another bowl. Mix it properly. 
8. Arrange all the vadas in a plate or a bowl. Pour the chili cilantro yogurt evenly on the vadas. Pour the sugar yogurt on top of it evenly. 
9. Sprinkle red chilli powder, black pepper powder, rosted cummin powder on the vadas.
