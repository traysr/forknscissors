3. Transfer the fritters on the paper. 
4. Heat 1½ table spoon of oil in a different pan. Add cloves, cinnamon and green cardamoms to it. When they start sizzling, add sliced onion and garlic pods. Saute for a minute. Add cashews and grated ginger. Saute continiously to avoid burning of onions. Add chopped tomatoes into the mixture. Slowly add all the masala powders and the salt. Saute the mixture until it blends together properly. Switch off the flame and let the mixture cool down. 
5. Transfer the cooled mixture into a grinder and make a smooth paste. Add little water if needed.
6. Heat 1½ table spoon of oil in the same pan and add the smooth paste to it. 
7. Saute for 5 minutes. Add the water you kept aside with additional one cup of water to the paste and stir it properly. Boil the mixture for 10-15 minutes. 
8. Before serving, add fritters to the curry. Sprinkle Kasuri methi on it. Serve immediately.
