title: "Maharashtrian Thali 1"
---



The name 'Thali' means platter. Maharashtra is a state in the western part of India. The typical Maharashtrian platter has bhaji (curry), aamti (daal) chapati or bhakri (Indian bread) bhat (rice),koshimbir (salad) lonache(pickle) and the dessert. 
In our day to day life, we don't have enough time to prepare everything. But, at least we can try to make the basic platter. 
I am going to try once a week some of my ideas of basic meal which will help you deciding your daily menu. I hope you will find it interesting and helpful.
