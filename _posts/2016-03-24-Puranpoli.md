### Ingredients:
* 4 cup chana dal
* 3 cup grated jaggary
* 1 cup sugar
* 3 cup whole wheat flour 
* 1 cup all purpose flour
* Ground nutmeg to taste
* Ground cardamom to taste
* Salt to taste

### Method:
### To make Puran:
1. Wash and rinse chana dal with water. Sprinkle little oil over the dal and mix it. Add 8 cups water in a pressure cooker, add dal and cook it for 3-4 whistles or until it gets cook fully. 
2. Remove dal from the pressure cooker and strain through a strainer. Save the drained water from dal to make _Katachi Amti_ 
3. Heat pan and add sugar and jaggary. Let it melt completely. Add cooked dal and cook it until the mixture thickens. Stir the mixture occasionaly. Add ground nutmeg and ground cardamom to the mixture. 
4. You can check the perfect consistency of _Puran_ by placing spatula straight in the center. If it does not fall, the mixture is ready. 
5.Transfer the hot chana dal stuffing to _Puran Yantra_. to strain. You can use the refular steel strainer if you don't have _Puran Yantra_.

### For the Cover:
1. Sift both the flours and mix them. Add salt and Â¼ cup oil. Prepare the dough by adding little water at a time. The dough should be smooth consistency. Press the dough in a plate with hand and add rest of the oil and keep it aside for 2 hours. 
2. After two hours again, knead the dough. The oil should get absorbed in the dough. 

### How to make puranpoli:
1. Make equal size balls from _Puran_ or the stuffing and also from the dough. 
2. Spread the dough ball to a small round with your hands or with the rolling pin. Place the stuffing ball on it. Seal the edges tightly and remove the excess dough if any.
3. Roll in a circle like Aloo Paratha. Roast from both the sides on a medium heat. 
4. Cool them on a paper. This recipe makes 35-40 Puranpolis.
