title: "Rice flour Dhirde"
---



### Ingredients:
* 1 cup rice flour
* 1 cup coconut milk
* 2 cup water
* Salt to taste

### Method:
1. Add rice flour, salt, coconut milk and water in a bowl. Mix well to a thin consistency batter. 
2. Heat tava or griddle. Pour the mixture on a tava like dosa and let it cook for a while. 
3. Spread little oil to the sides of dhirde. Cook from both the side by flipping to other side. 
4. Serve immediately with yogurt. 

### Note:
1. I used canned coconut milk. Since it was too thick, I have to add 2 cups of water. If the coconut milk is thin, adjust the water accordingly. The consistency should be thin. 
2. Instead of water, you can use only coconut milk.
3. You can add 1 teaspoon of cummin seeds to the batter.
