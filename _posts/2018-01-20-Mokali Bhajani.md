_Mokali Bhajani_ is a typical breakfast or snack in Maharashtrian households. _Bhajani_ is  a mixture of different flours roasted individually with Indian spices in it.

It tastes amazing with freshly churned butter or homemade yogurt. 
Mokali bhajani is like _upma_. It tastes as good as any other maharashtrian breakfast or snack recipes. Hope you will enjoy this awesome dish! 

# Serves:2 persons

### Ingredients:
* 1 cup thalipeeth bhajani
* 1 small onion chopped
* 4-5 curry leaves
* 3 tablespoon oil
* ½ teaspoon mustard seeds
* ½ teaspoon cumin seeds
* ¼ teaspoon asafoetida
* ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder
* ½ teaspoon red chilli powder
* 1 tablespoon fresh grated coconut
* 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro
* water  
* Salt to taste

### Method:
1. Add thalipeeth bhajani in a bowl. Add enough water to make a smooth mixture (I used 1 cup of water).  Add salt in it and keep it aside for 5-7 minutes. 
2. Heat oil in a pan. Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds. When they start crackling, add asafoetida, turmeric, curry leaves, and red chilli powder. Mix and add chopped onion. 
3. Fry onion for a while and add bhajani mixture. Mix with spatula and keep the lid on. Let it cook for around 20 minutes. Stir after each 5 minutes. 
4. Turn off the heat. Let it be there with lid on. The steam will make bhajani more delicious. 
5. Serve hot with chopped cilantro and fresh grated coconut on top.
