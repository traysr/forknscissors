# Serves: 3-4 persons

Kale is one of my favorite leafy greens. Low in calorie and high in fibre. Kale has a strong flavor So, I like to mix it with Indian lentils. I used to make this recipe on a regular basis but, with Spinach or Fenugreek. When I discovered the benifits of Kale, I started using in my daily diet. 

In this recipe, I have used combination of toor dal and moong dal. You can use only toor dal or moong dal. Masoor dal is also another option. The result will always be tasty. :) 
Hope you find this recipe intresting! 

### Ingredients:
* ½ cup toor dal
* ½ cup moong dal
* 2 cups chopped kale leaves
* 3-4 chopped garlic pods
* 2 teaspoon grated ginger 
* 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
* ½ teaspoon asafoetida
* 1 teaspoon red chilli powder
* ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder
* Salt to taste
* 1 small onion chopped finely
* 1 medium tomato chopped finely
* 3 tablespoon oil
* 1 cup water

### Method:
1. Wash toor dal and moong dal together and drain the water. Add 3 cups of fresh water to dals. Add little salt and pinch of turmeric powder. Cook in a pressure cooker for 6-7 whistles. Let the pressure goes down completely. 
2. Add 1 tablespoon oil in a pan. Add half of the chopped garlic and half of the cumin seeds. Let them sizzle. Add chopped onion and grated ginger. Saute for a while. Add in chopped tomatoes and mix everything.
3. Add chopped kale to the pan. Cook until kale is completely cooked. 
4. Add cooked dal and mix well. Add water and salt. (be careful while adding salt since there is salt in cooked dal.) 
5. Check the water consistency. Add more if you like runny dal. Cook dal and kale mixture on a medium hat for 10 minutes. 
6. Add 2 tablespoon oil in another pan. Add remaining chopped garlic and cumin seeds. Let the garlic become golden brown. Add asafoetida, turmeric powder, and red chilli powder. Pour this seasoning over cooked dal. 
7. Serve hot with rice or roti.
