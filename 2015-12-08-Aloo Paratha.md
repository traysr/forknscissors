### Ingredients:

### For the filling:
* 4 medium boiled potatoes
* 1 tablespoon ginger chili paste 
* 1 tablespoon crushed fennel seeds
* 1 tablespoon amchoor powder (dry mango powder)
* Â½ teaspoon turmeric powder(optional)
* Chopped cilantro 
* Salt and pepper to taste

### For the cover:
* 3 cups wheat flour
* 1 tablespoon oil
* Salt to taste 
* Water to knead the dough

### Method:
1. Get whole wheat flour and add salt to it. Use enough water to make the dough. The dough should not be too thin or too thick. Rest the dough for 15 minutes.
2. Add boiled potatoes in a bowl and mash them with your hands. Do not use the masher since it will be difficult while rolling paratha. 
3. Add chili-ginger paste, fennel seeds, amchoor powder, chopped cilantro to the mashed potatoes. Mix everything and divide them into 8-10 balls. 
4. Get the whole wheat dough and knead it again and make 8-10 balls out of it. 
5. Get one flour ball and roll out in a small disk using roiiling pin. Get a potato ball and place it in the center of rolled flour ball. Gather the edges and seal them together. 
6. Flatten this ball with your hands and dip into the flour. Roll out in a big circle using the rolling pin. 
7. Heat the tava/griddle. Place the rolled paratha and brush the sides and the center with some oil or butter. Cook from both the sides by flipping the other side. 
8. Serve hot with ketchup or green chutney or yogurt.
