# Serving: 3-4 persons

### Ingredients:
* 1 cup chopped Methi (Fenugreek) leaves
* 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
* ½ teaspoon turmeric powder
* ½ teaspoon red chili powder
* 1 teaspoon corriander powder
* 1 teaspoon sesame seeds
* 1 tablespoon oil + oil to brush
* 1½ cup whole wheat flour + flour to dust
* Salt to taste

### Method: 
1. Get methi leaves in a bowl. Add ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, corriander powder, sesame seeds, salt, and 1 tablespoon oil. Mix everything properly.
2. Add whole wheat flour and make a dough. The dough should not be too firm or too thin. Keep it aside for 15 minutes. 
3. Heat tava or griddle. Divide the dough into 10-12 balls. There are two ways to roll the paratha.
# Type 1:
1. Get one ball , dust into the whole wheat flour and roll out into a medium size circle using the rolling pin. 
2. Place the rolled paratha on tava/griddle and brush the sides and the center with some oil. Cook from both the sides by flipping to the other side.  Do the same thing with rest of the balls.
# Type 2: 
1. Get one ball, dust into the flour. Roll out to a small circle. Brush the surface of the circle with little oil. Sprinkle some flour on it. Fold the circle into a triangle. 
2. Dip the triangle into the flour and roll out into a big circle or a triangle. Place the rolled paratha on tava/griddle and brush the sides and the center with some oil. Cook from both the sides by flipping to the other side.  Do the same thing with rest of the balls.
