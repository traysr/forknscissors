3. Add cilantro, garlic, ginger and green chillies in a blender, and blend them to a paste.
4. Get a plate or bowl. Add cooked sprouts. Mash them roughly with masher. Mash a boiled potato and add it to the sprouts. Add the paste from above step. Add salt, garam masala and dry mango powder. Make 8 -9 round balls out of the mixture. 
5. On your kitchen board, sprinkle some dry flour. Roll one ball into a small circle. Add the stuffing ball in the center. Fold the edges ensuring the filling is not coming out.
6. Roll out into paratha with the help of some flour. Heat Tava/griddle and place the paratha on it. Drizzle some oil or butter on the sides. Turn it over and cook from other side too.
