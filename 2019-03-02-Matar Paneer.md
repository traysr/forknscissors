# Serves: 4-5 persons

Matar Paneer is a classic Indian dish which consists of green peas and Indian cottage cheese cooked in a onion-tomato based gravy with Indian spices. This curry is usually medium spicy, so kids love this a lot. You can substitute paneer with potato or tofu. It goes well with rice, naan or roti. 
The taste of subzi depends on the taste of gravy you prepare. The gravy can be made ahead of time. My mom used to make this gravy and store it in the freezer for almost a month. If you have this gravy ready you can make matar paneer anytime. I usually make this dish for parties for mainly two reasons. First- everyone loves paneer and second- it saves my time and I can spend time on making another dish. 
This is my mom's recipe and she used to teach this in her cooking classes. So many of her students still follow this recipe. 
Today, I am sharing her tips and the recipe with you all. Do give it a try and share your feedback.

2. Serve hot with rice or naan, or roti. 

## Notes and tips:
1. I always use khoya while making the gravy. You can substitute khoya by using milk mawa powder ( store brought). 
You can completely avoid using mawa too. Then, you may want to increase fresh cream and cashews. This depends on the sweetness of the gravy you want. 
2. Kashmiri red chilli powder can be easily found in Indian grocery shop. This chilli powder is good for the colour of your gravy and it is less spicy. If you dont have one, use regular chilli powder according to your spice level. 
3.If you want to store the gravy, Let it cool down completely. Store it in a proper freezer airtight container. Store it in a freezer and not in the refrigerator. 
4. For defrosting,remove gravy from the freezer at least 6-7 hours before. Keep the container in a room temperature. (may be on the countertop) Once you defroast the gravy, do not put it back in the freezer. You have to use all the gravy. 
5. If you want to use red food colour , you can use it.
