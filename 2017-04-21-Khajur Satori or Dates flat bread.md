---



# Makes 6-7 flat breads

### Ingredients:

### For the stuffing: 
* 1 cup dates
* 2 tablespoon dry grated coconut
* 2 teaspoon poppy seeds
* 2 tablespoon milk powder
* 1 teaspoon cardamom powder

### For the Cover:
* 1 cup whole wheat flour + flour for dusting
* 1 tablespoon ghee/butter
* ½ -¾ cup milk
* Pinch of salt

### Method:
1. Remove seeds from the dates if you are not using seedless dates. Chop them roughly and add them to a grinder. Make a paste and keep it aside in a seperate bowl.
2. Dry roast poppy seeds and coconut in a pan seperately until the raw smell goes away. Add it to the dates paste. Mix everything and keep it aside with a lid on it. 
3. Get a bowl and add whole wheat flour in it. Add salt and mix it. 
4. Heat a pan and add ghee/butter in it. Add this hot ghee over the wheat flour. Mix everything with your hands. Make a medium soft dough by adding little milk at a time. Cover it with a damp cloth and keep it aside for one hour. 
5. After one hour, knead the dough again and make equal size balls. Get a stuffing and make the same amount of balls. 
6. Get one flour ball and roll out in a small disk using rolling pin. Get a dates stuffing ball and place it in the center of rolled flour ball. Gather the edges and seal them together. 
7. Flatten this ball with your hands and roll out in a small circle using very little flour for dusting. The _Satori_ should not be thin. 
8. Heat tava/griddle and place this rolled flat bread and brush the sides and the center with some ghee/butter. Cook from both the sides by flipping the other side. 
9. Serve hot or cold with ghee/butter. You can store these for a week in a airtight container.
