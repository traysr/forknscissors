title: "Cauliflower-Peas Curry or Rassa"
---


# Serves: 2-3 persons

The word curry or rassa means vegetables cooked with gravy. This is a very common subzi in Maharashtrian households. It's a combination of onion, ginger-garlic and mixed vegetables of your choice. 
The following recipe is a little different from the usual since it has no onion or garlic. It has a perfect tomato-coconut based gravy which adds thickness to the curry. My mom used to make this curry specially during religious festival seasons where the food is prepared with no onion and garlic. So, I thought it would be nice to share the recipe with all of you:) Hope you will find it intresting and tasty!
